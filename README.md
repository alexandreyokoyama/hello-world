# hello-world

Hi everyone
In early 2017 I was introduced by a friend to the world of Raspberry Pi3, as part of the makers movement. Using such tool, I could download a Linux to run like a set top box (Android box) and just to set this using OSMC took me some good hours of fun and revival (I was born in the 70s and it will be subject to another post). Another project was to create a desktop computer, with keyboard, mouse, browser and some office applications, using Raspbian. The last project I am entertained with is to create a personal Wifi+VPN.
